## Author System

All three blog directories (`research/`, `insights/`, `newsroom/`) each have an `authors.yml` file that defines the `allan` author:
```yaml
allan:
  name: "Allan B. Pedin IV"
  title: "Software Engineer & Developer"
  url: "https://abpiv.dev"
  image_url: "/img/headshot.png"
  socials:
    github: "BrewDogDev"
    x: "allanpedin"
    linkedin: "allanpedin"
```

All blog posts frontmatter should use `author: allan`.

---

## Deployment

- **baseUrl**: `/info/`
- **url**: `https://allanbpediniv.com`
- Preview branch: `preview`
- Preview URL: `https://content-site.lobst3rs.com/info/`
- Production branch: `main`
- Production URL: `https://allanbpediniv.com/info/`
- Production domain discovery: use the live domain that returns `200`; apex `allanbpediniv.com` is the current chosen production domain because `www.allanbpediniv.com` did not resolve during discovery.
- Production deploys: manual `Content Site` workflow dispatch from `main` with `target=production`
- GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs content-site CI, preview auto-deploys, and manual production deploys to Cloudflare Pages.
- Preview analytics collection uses `PLAUSIBLE_SITE_DOMAIN=content-site.lobst3rs.com` and same-origin `/_analytics/*` paths, but the current analytics infrastructure only provisions `allanbpediniv.com/_analytics/*`. Extend the separate analytics infrastructure/route before expecting preview analytics collection.
- Cloudflare Pages project: `abpiv-personal-brand`
- See [`AI_HANDOFF.md`](./AI_HANDOFF.md) for the current deployment architecture, packaging details, credentials, and verification commands.

## Known Issues / Notes

- `blogDir` warning refers to old default path - harmless
- Dark-only theme enforced via `colorMode.disableSwitch: true`
- Social icons in footer use `@fortawesome/react-fontawesome` (brands + solid packages installed)

```yaml

author: allan

description: "Brief description for SEO"
